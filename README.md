## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Another good lesson in understanding grid layout.

### Continued development

There is still a lot to learn in regards to creating responsive layouts using grid. 
I need to pay more attention to structure css code, to make it easy to understand 
and maintain in the future.
